# What is it?

BBO is a little script this extends the functionality of the "Buy Orders" system on the Steam Community Market. This script uses available data to extend the amount of buy and sell orders seen beyond the standard 5 rows. It also allows for you to quickly change the currency in which you view the buy order system in order to see the distribution of quantity more easily.
